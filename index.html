                  Sometime in 1985, Layne Staley, Johnny Bacolas, and James
                  Bergstrom formed a glam rock band called Sleze. Layne said "we
                  played speed metal and dressed in drag". In 1986, the band
                  gained one new member named Nick Pollock. Sleze turned into
                  "Alice N' Chains".

                  Layne met Jerry Cantrell in 1986. They were both struggling
                  musicians trying to make a living. They later became
                  roommates. Alice N' Chains disbanded and Layne joined a funk
                  band. Layne asked Jerry to join the funk band. Jerry said only
                  under one condition: if Layne also joined his band which
                  included bassist Mike Starr and drummer Sean Kinney. Layne
                  said yes.

                  Eventually, the funk band broke up some time in 1987. Layne
                  was now in Jerry's band full-time. The band took the name
                  "Alice in Chains".

                  On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released their most
                  successful and critically acclaimed album, Dirt. Dirt was #6
                  on the Billboard 200 and was certified "quadruple platinum".
                  AIC didn't tour for Dirt for that long due to Layne's drug
                  addiction. While AIC was on tour, Mike Starr apparently left
                  the band for "personal reasons", but many years later Mike
                  says in an interview "I was kicked out because of my drug
                  addiction". Mike was replaced by Mike Inez.

                  Jar of Flies is released. It was the first EP to ever make #1
                  on the Billboard 200. Because of Layne's terrible conditions,
                  the band decided not to tour for Jar of Flies. Layne was put
                  into a rehab clinic and also began to work on a side project
                  with Michael McCready from Pearl Jam, and Barrett Martin from
                  Screaming Trees.

                  after Kurt Cobain's death, Layne made a surprise appearance.
                  He looked very sick and wore a ski mask to cover his face. His
                  condition was getting worse from heroin addiction. Mark Arm
                  from the band Mudhoney was quoted saying "I remember seeing
                  Layne in 1995. He turned up and was totally green, and my
                  stomach turned at that point - watching somebody on a track
                  that they couldn't get off."

                  "Staley weighed 80 pounds and was white as a ghost."
